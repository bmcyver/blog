Hello! I'm 김부민(Kim Boomin) aka bmcyver. I am currently studying web security ~~and binary exploitation~~.
Also, I'm playing CTFs as [DeadSec](https://deadsec.team/) and 미스크올솔로교통비쟁취(Korean CTFs).

I started this blog to share my knowledge and experience in web security and CTFs.
I hope you find it helpful and informative.
